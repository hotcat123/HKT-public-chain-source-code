## About HKT

hkt's purpose is to enable community-driven innovation to benefit people around the world.

To achieve this purpose, _HKT_ provides a developer platform where developers and entrepreneurs can create apps that put users back in control of their data and assets, which is the foundation of ["Open Web" movement][open-web-url].

One of the components of _hkt_ is the hkt Protocol, an infrastructure for server-less applications and smart contracts powered by a blockchain.
hkt Protocol is built to deliver usability and scalability of modern PaaS like Firebase at fraction of the prices that blockchains like Ethereum charge.



## Join the Network

The easiest way to join the network, is by using the `hktup` command, which you can install as follows:

```bash
pip3 install --user hktup
```

You can join all the active networks:

- mainnet: `hktup run mainnet`
- testnet: `hktup run testnet`
- betanet: `hktup run betanet`

Check the `hktup` repository for [more details](https://github.com/hkt/hktup) how to run with or without docker.
